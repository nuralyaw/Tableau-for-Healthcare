# Tableau for Healthcare

I took on this project to improve my visualisations skills on Tableau, especially on making interactive dashboards. I created these dashboards with the guidance of the Udemy eLearning course, Tableau for Heallthcare. This course has allowed me to gain a better understanding on how to make healthcare dashboards more compelling and informative, focusing on the quality rather than the complexity.

It is currently a work in progress, reflecting my ongoing journey through the course. The interactive dashboards I've worked on are based on simulated hospital datasets that contain information such as admission dates, discharge dates, blood pressure readings, and detailed patient demographics.

As I continue to advance, I look forward to exploring more concepts and refining these dashboards to offer a comprehensive understanding of healthcare analytics.
